# HOMR

## Description

HOMR is an application that allows the user to view current wins and losses of the MLB season. As well as viewing home game events of the season and a travel time approximation to get to the venue. This app runs in any browser and features dynamically updated HTML webpage elements
and a CSS framework (Bulma) for the styling of the webpage. As well as using open source Javascript libraries such as Chart.JS and Jquery for the generation of content and using server-side apis to fetch the needed data.
